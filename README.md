# 🚀 Archcraft Debian Installer

## Installing the Archcraft Debian Installer

To turn the script into an executable "app" and run it, follow these steps:

1. **Make it executable**
   Open a terminal in the directory where the script is located and run:

```bash
chmod +x archcraft-debian-installer.sh
```

2. **Run the installer**
   Still in the same directory, launch the script:

```bash
./archcraft-debian-installer.sh
```

🎉 That’s it! The installer will guide you through transforming your Debian system into Archcraft Openbox style with a full GUI.

Enjoy! 🙂
